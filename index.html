                My rather unconventional background includes a diverse range of experience; I am truly a "jack of all trades" in every respect.  A curious series of events led me to where I am today; my innate creativity is now firmly interleaved with a newfound passion for the technical.  Highly imaginitive by nature, I tend to thrive (and do my best work) where ingenuity is valued and encouraged.

                My initial foray into the realm of digital art was nearly twenty years ago, reproducing vector-based logos for a small promotional products company.  Later, as co-owner of that same business, graphic design became an integral part of my full-time duties.

                This often leaves people a bit baffled, but the vast majority of my professional experience was in law enforcement.  During an otherwise quiet shift one evening, that career came to an abrupt end; I had been a police officer for over ten years.  After three surgeries and months of physical therapy, we'll just say "the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound" is no longer part of my skill set.

                So there I was, in my early forties, confronted with a question of "what to be when I grow up" for the second time.  By pure happenstance, I discovered our local LaunchCode program while watching some local-interest programming on PBS one evening.  After attending several meet-ups and exploring the various options, I began charting a course toward my new career path in web development.
